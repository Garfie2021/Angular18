## Angular18/Src4_PageTransition/

Steps to add components and transition to pages in Angular.

We added components to the Angular project created in the steps to add a side menu to Angular, and added a page transition function for the SPA application.

The app-routing.module.ts file, which was required up to Angular 17, is no longer necessary from Angular 18, making it easier to implement routing.

## Angular18/Src5_Add_PRIME-NG/

Steps to add a PrimeNG button in Angular.

I installed the PrimeNG design framework and added a PrimeNG button to the Angular project created in Steps to add components and transition pages in Angular.

Since animation is not necessary for business web apps, I turned off the button animation when adding a PrimeNG button this time.
I made a video to show the difference between turning animation on and off.

When developing business web applications with Angular, I recommend PrimeNG over Angular Material Design and NG Bootstrap as a design framework.
The design of Angular Material Design does not look business-like.
The design of NG Bootstrap looks business-like, but Angular's response speed is slow.
The design of PrimeNG is closer to NG Bootstrap and looks business-like, it has more components than NG Bootstrap, it is free to use, and support is available for a fee.
